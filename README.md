* highlight.js: response highlighter

## Principles
Project tries to follow these principles:
* KISS and YAGNI trying to maintain project light in code and libraries
* Keep the focus on result: the development cycle is composed by two steps: the first takes deliberately technological debt to ship features in a quick way, the second applies a phase of refactor to maintain the code clean.

The project follows the semantic versioning
